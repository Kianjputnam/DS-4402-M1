# NBA Rookie Sentiment Analysis  

## Goals and Theories

Motivation and Context: 
Statistics like PER, Win Shares, and Plus-Minus are widely used to measure a playerâ€™s performance on the court, but scouting reports offer qualitative evaluations that capture traits/intangibles/potential like basketball IQ, work ethic, clutch, coachability,  and instinctsâ€”attributes that donâ€™t always show up in box scores. Despite their importance in draft decisions, little research has tested whether the sentiment in pre-draft scouting reports can actually predict rookie performance in the NBA.

Hypothesis
Pre-draft scouting report sentiment correlates with rookie performance.

Research Question: 
Do the sentiment scores of the 2023 NBA rookie pre-draft scouting reports correlate with the playersâ€™ performance metrics in their rookie season?

## Reproducing Results

- Our NBA stats data came from NBA.com and NBAReference.com. They are found in Reference_stats1.xls and Reference_stats2.xls which were merged using Compiling_stats_code.ipynb to form merged_nba_stats2.csv (if reference stats are not working properly due to excel reading error, you can just refer to merged_nba_stats2.csv)

- scraper.py was used to get the scouting reports online and were turned into scouting_reports.csv, which was then compiled into merged_nba_rookie_data.csv

- textblob_analysis.ipynb was performed and compiled to rookie_data_textblob.csv

- Sentiment_Analysis_Correlations.ipynb was performed on rookie_data_textblob.csv and displays our findings. This also contains most of the figures shown in our presentation
