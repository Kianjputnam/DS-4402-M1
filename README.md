# NBA Rookie Sentiment Analysis  

## Goals and Theories

Motivation and Context: 
Statistics like PER, Win Shares, and Plus-Minus are widely used to measure a playerâ€™s performance on the court, but scouting reports offer qualitative evaluations that capture traits/intangibles/potential like basketball IQ, work ethic, clutch, coachability,  and instinctsâ€”attributes that donâ€™t always show up in box scores. Despite their importance in draft decisions, little research has tested whether the sentiment in pre-draft scouting reports can actually predict rookie performance in the NBA.

Hypothesis
Pre-draft scouting report sentiment correlates with rookie performance.

Research Question: 
Do the sentiment scores of the 2023 NBA rookie pre-draft scouting reports correlate with the playersâ€™ performance metrics in their rookie season?
